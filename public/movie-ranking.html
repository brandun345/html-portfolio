<h1>My Top Movies of 2023</h1> 
<h2>My favorite top three movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>No One Will Save You</h3>
<p>This movie will be the top out of the three. The way it portrayed the aliens as creepy and glitchy looking.
    <p>The ending gave a different perspective as the antagonist became a part of the alien system and joined in taking over the town.       
    </p>

<h3>Barbie</h3>
    <p>This movie places second on my list, this movie talks about the struggle women go through and really opened my eyes to their struggles.</p>
    <p>I do plan on showing my mother this movie, I feel that she would really be able to resonate with the message it gives.</p>
    
<h3>The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</h3>
    <p>This movie cames in third, there were some part of the movie that did a lot of talking and felt like they were taking a while to get tot he point.</p>
    <p>The way Viola Davis delivers the lines as the evil scientist was perfection. She really embodied the cahracter and delivered her lines with passion.</p>
