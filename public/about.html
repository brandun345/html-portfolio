<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Brandon Martinez and I recently quit my job to persue coding. I have never really had the time to sit down and actually get this far. 
  Now that I dont have a job, my friend bought this "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" for me and I have been spending these last few days learning HTML!
  Although I am not sure where exactly I will land with learning this new skill, I am still very excited to see where it takes me.</p>


<p>Another fact about myself is that I am the proud owner of two cats and a dog, the cats names are Anubis and Venus, and my dog is named Neo. 
  I adore them with all my heart, and as I am typing this Anubis is a little sick and seems to possbily have asthma! I guess she gets it from her owner. I enjoy 
  going on long walks with my dog and always get him a puppuccino from Starbucks. It is his favorite snack!

<p>As mentioned, I recently quit my job to persue this new career path. I know I am on the correct path as only two days into studying my good friend that goes to Stanford let me know if I ever need help I can shoot him a text or call!
  He also even offered to pass on a project he has been working on for practice and to get a better understanding, he would also be guiding me throughout the process.
  Yes I am nervouse about this next chapter in life but I am happy I am doing something i enjoy. Instead of selling insurance.
